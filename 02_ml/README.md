## Machine Learning Examples

The examples here cover a few simple, but widely used machine learning models: boosted decision trees (BDT), fully-connected feed-forward deep neural networks (DNN), autoencoder, and convolutional neural networks (CNN). We also include an example illustrating simulation-based inference.

| hzz4l_sklearn         | Boosted Decision Trees (BDT) with AdaBoost: classification of Higgs boson events    |
| hzz4l_pytorch    | Deep Neural Network (DNN): classification of Higgs boson events |
| autoencoder1d    | Autoencoder: map SDSS galaxy/quasar data to 1D |
| mnist_cnn        | Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): classification of MNIST digits |
| 01_phantom..., 02_phantom..., 03_phantom... | Simulation-Based Inference (SBI): infer parameters of a 2-parameter cosmological model using simulation-based inference. The first notebook generates the simulated Type 1a data; the 2nd notebook performs the simulation-based inference (aka, likelihood-free inference), while the 3rd notebook checks the coverage of the confidence sets. The 2-parameter cosmological model is described in phantom_model.ipynb|
